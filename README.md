# 24 Game Solver

This script finds all solutions to the 24 Game. In this game, the player must use all 4 integers provided, along with any standard operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to yield 24. More info at https://www.24game.com/t-about-howtoplay.aspx .

This script is generalized to handle any target number (not just 24), with any number of integers entered - the user is prompted to enable this functionality at the start of execution. 

## Usage

This was tested with Python 3.9.7. No guarantees for earlier versions. Run the main file to start the solver.

No special packages were used.

## Credits

This project was inspired by a math game that a few of my middle school teachers used to have us play. Find more information on the official game here: https://www.24game.com/ .
